This project grew out of my desire to replace PHP-based FruitShow forum for
my Sumatra PDF viewer with Google App Engine-based solution.

It works, it can be used for hosting your own forums and I'm using it myself.

Of course, there's always something to improve and below is my whishlist. I'm
sure you'll have no trouble coming up with your own list of possible
improvements.

TODO must have:
 - Stickies
 - Email users
 - Rss
 - Anti-spam protection
 - Search
 - Simple image posting
 - Use memcached

TODO nice to have:
 - Textile formatting of posts
 - Mass delete of posts from a given ip address and/or user account
 - Use ajax google search ui
 - Better code comments
